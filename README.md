## 💻 Project

The page was developed in the issue of **NLW Heat**, which preceded DoWhile2021. The event was organized by [Rocketseat](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/) 🚀

The DoWhile Virtual Badge is a static application with the objective of showing the user information brought from the GitHub API and inserting it in a layout with the face of the DoWhile 2021 event. It was developed for the Web version but has its layout in a responsive way, being possible to access it from a smartphone, tablet, notebook and desktop.
